# Volatile
A modular C++ program that simulates and visualizes RAM behavior at the bit level. It models memory as a structured 3D grid, where each cube represents a single bit within a word. The system tracks allocation and deallocation events, rendering state transitions in real time to expose the underlying architecture of memory usage.
